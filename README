This is a stripped, lightweight version of MarkerClusterer by Luke Mehe that originally can be found at
http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/markerclusterer/

This modification of the clusterer uses Google Maps original Markers to display cluster icons and therefore
is missing a feature of displaying number of markers inside a cluster.
